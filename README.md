"101 Formulaic Alphas" is a paper published in WorldQuant, gives 101 alpha factors formulas. I tried to realize almost all the factors in Python, and test on stock index of A-market "沪深300". But the variable vwap absolutely could not be used directly on stock index, so it is just a test to figure out whether these functions work as we wish.

test.py calculates all the factors of index, and the correlations between factors and index, output as corr.csv.
